# BN6 Daniel

This is a joke patch that implements intentionally bad game mechanics for Battle Network 6. 
This is designed to be used with the Tango netplay solution over at <https://github.com/tangobattle/tango>  


## Features
Features from Bingus that don't conflict with any Daniel changes are included because I copy pasted the BBN6 folder to make this.  
Decrossing from elemental weakness is removed.  
Time Freeze Counters are disabled.  
Back row panels can be stolen like in BNs 1-3 (thanks weenie).
